# Airflow Training
Initially created for a Apache Airflow 2.3, in the process of building an Airflow 3.1 training. 

# Folders

## 2.0
Very useful if you are still using the older version, especially the tuning.sh has parameters that need to be changed in GKE or VM based setups. 

## 3.1
All new work would be put in here. 

# Completed work

## 3.1/vm/airflow-install.md

Cloud composer is the managed version of Apcahce Airflow and easiest way to get started. But it is not the ideal solution from a cost perspective, so we will install it on a single VM instance on Google Cloud. 

# WIP

## IMDB data ingestion pipelines
This is work in progress
